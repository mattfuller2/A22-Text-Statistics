# Project 4: Text Statistics

* Author: Matt Fuller
* Class: CS121 Section 6
* Semester: Spring 2017

## Overview

In this program, you are going to implement a program that analyzes 
text files to generate some useful statistics.

## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
```
$ javac ProcessText.java
```

Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java ProcessText
```

## Discussion
I had trouble figuring out how to create a file using the String arguments
the user inputted into the console.

After creating and importing the neccessary classes, I began creating this
program by hard-coding a file name so I could test my TextStatistics class.
  
One of the most challenging parts about this project for me was using an
array and the "try-catch" for reading files. This project provided me with
more practice with arrays and file scanning.  

## Testing

To test the project, execute the following command in the main project directory:
```
$ ./autograde.sh
```

If you get a "Permission Denied" error, you must make the autograde.sh script executable 
using the following command.
```

$ chmod +x autograde.sh
```

Then execute the following command in the main project directory again:
```
$ ./autograde.sh
```

This will run the project to make sure everything works properly and is will print the 
results to the console.
